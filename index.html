                        <article> My name is Yannik Büchi and I am a developer (at least I hope so by the end of this course) hailing from from Bogotá, Colombia and Le Vaud, Switzerland. I am a big fan of everything Swiss (as you could've guessed), from Roger Federer to Toblerone, from velcro to Rivella and MiniPics. I've lived for twenty-one years out of my twenty-four in the United States, and I guess it's a pretty okay place.
                                <br><br> I currently hold (and hopefully always will) a Bachelor's of the Arts degree with a major in French Studies and Biology from Colby College. During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the University of Konstanz in Germany as a lab assistant and summer student, and at the Bigelow Laboratory for Oceans Sciences in Boothbay, Maine. My time in the laboratory taught me that I particularly enjoyed the aspect of manipulating and visualizing data. 
                                <br><br>Upon graduation I then moved back to my home state of New York, where I currently work at ITHAKA as Publisher Support Associate for the academic publishing platform JSTOR. Aside from the serious stuff, I love to play the piano. I started playing at the age of seven, and haven't stopped. My favorite composer is unquestionably Chopin, who, in my humble opinion, has produced quite a few of the most beautiful pieces in the world. Nowadays, I practice on my small keyboard that I've brought with me everywhere I've lived, from Westchester, New York, to Waterville, Maine, back to Westchester, New York, and then on to Queens, and then to Manhattan, and then back to Queens. Hopefully someday, it will make it overseas, either to Paris or Berlin. Another one of my favorite activities is skiing. As my mother once said as she responded to a friend who asked her if we skied: "We are Swiss. We ski." And that pretty much sums our family mantra. Our favorite family skiing area is Alta/Snowbird in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah, where the best snow on earth lives.</article>
